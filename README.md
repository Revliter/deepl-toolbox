This repo is to facilitate experiments of deep learning.

Most implementations here are based on some common dependencies so that they can be modified easily.

It is composed of:
- datasets: fast dataset loading and preprocessing
- logging: better logging tools
- losses: library of different losses
- pretrained_models: quick training of different models on different datasets. (or just load from some place)
- visualization: visualization tools to better understand the network
